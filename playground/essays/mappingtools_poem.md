# The Cartographer's Code

The data sprawls, a wild and pathless sea,
Of nested dicts and JSON mystery.
Where keys are lost in depths of dark despair,
And loops entangle in the stagnant air.

But here, a compass for the wandering mind,
A set of tools, specifically designed.
To tame the chaos, make the structure clear,
And bring the distant values close and near.

**The Lens** descends, a laser sharp and bright,
To pierce the layers, bringing truth to light.
It reads and writes with surgical precision,
Without a clone, without a deep division.

**The Pivot** turns the world upon its side,
Where rows and columns can no longer hide.
It reshapes mountains into plains of data,
A transformation for the operator.

**The Collector** gathers fragments from the storm,
And gives the scattered dust a solid form.
It counts and stacks, it filters and it sorts,
Reporting back with elegant reports.

**The Dictifier** stands, a proxy guard,
To make the access simple, never hard.
It wraps the objects in a gentle guise,
And lets you query with your own eyes.

So take these tools, and let your code expand,
For now you hold the map, and rule the land.
